## Python: Intro to Lists

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **lists-starter**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder


### Objective

> *In this practice project, you'll learn how to:*
>
> * define a Python list
>
> * add elements to a Python list
> 
> * print the elements in a Python list


### Your Tasks

- Complete the **TRY IT YOURSELF** activities, p. 36, PCC
- Use comments to label each activity in your script
  - Example: # 3-1 Names, # 3-2 Greetings, etc.

### 3-1 Names:
Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called *names*.  Print each person's
name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

### 3-2 Greetings:

Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person's
name, print a message to them.

The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with 
the person's name.

### 3-3 Your Own List:

Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list
that stores several examples of different modes of transportation.

Use your list to print a series of statements about these list items, such as "*I would like to own
a Honda motorcycle.*"
